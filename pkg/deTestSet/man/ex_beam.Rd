\title{Motion of Inextensible Elastic Beam, ODE}
\description{
The beam modulator problem is a problem from mechanics, describing the 
motion of an elastic beam, supposed inextensible, of length 1 and thin.

It is an ordinary differential equation of dimension 80.

}
\usage{
beam (times=seq(0, 5, by = 0.01), yini = NULL, method = gamd, ...) 
}

\arguments{
  \item{yini }{the initial (state) values for the DE system. If \code{y}
    has a name attribute, the names will be used to label the output
    matrix.
  }
  \item{times }{time sequence for which output is wanted; the first
    value of \code{times} must be the initial time.
  }
  \item{method }{the solver to use
  }
  \item{... }{additional arguments passed to the solver .
  }
}
\value{
  A matrix of class \code{deSolve} with up to as many rows as elements in
  \code{times} and as many
  columns as elements in \code{yini}, plus an additional column (the first) 
  for the time value.

  There will be one row for each element in \code{times} unless the
  solver returns with an unrecoverable error.  If
  \code{yini} has a names attribute, it will be used to label the columns
  of the output value.
